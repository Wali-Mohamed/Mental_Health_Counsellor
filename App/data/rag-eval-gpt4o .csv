"There are several classes of antidepressants, each affecting different neurotransmitters in the brain. Here are the common classes and examples of medications within them:

1. **SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors):** These include medications like fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft). They primarily work by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic cell.

2. **SNRIs (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):** Examples include venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta). These medications increase levels of serotonin and norepinephrine by inhibiting their reuptake.

3. **NDRIs (Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors):** Bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) is a common NDRI, which works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.

4. **NaSSAs (Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants):** Mirtazapine (Remeron) falls under this class, which increases norepinephrine and serotonin by antagonizing their receptors.

5. **SARIs (Serotonin Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitors):** Trazodone (Desyrel) is a part of this category, which modulates serotonin levels through antagonistic and reuptake inhibition mechanisms.

Older classes like MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) and tricyclics are usually considered when newer medications do not work, due to their more significant side effect profiles. Additionally, other medications like lithium or antipsychotics may be used in combination with antidepressants to enhance effect. Antidepressants can also be prescribed for conditions like anxiety disorders, and it's essential to have ongoing discussions with a healthcare provider to tailor treatment to individual needs.",4925221,What are the different classes of antidepressants and how do they work?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer thoroughly outlines the different classes of antidepressants, providing specific examples and a description of how each class works, which directly addresses the question asked."

"Vaping refers to the use of a device that transforms liquids, often flavored, into vapour that is then inhaled. A typical vaping device includes a mouthpiece, a tank or reservoir for the liquid, a heating element, and a battery.

Mental health encompasses our beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and it's influenced by various psychological, biological, and social factors, as well as life events. 

Preventing challenges from becoming serious involves developing your well-being and resilience, and seeking help early. While some people may offer advice with good intentions, it's crucial to find what works best for you personally. Understanding the difference between mental health and mental illness can also be helpful.
