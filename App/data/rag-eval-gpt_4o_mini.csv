"CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) helps individuals manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours by teaching them how these elements influence each other. Through CBT, individuals learn that a change in one factor—be it a thought or behaviour—can lead to positive changes in the other factors as well. For example, if someone believes that people don’t like them (thought), they might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). CBT encourages individuals to challenge negative, unhelpful thoughts, allowing them to see situations more realistically and recognize their own strengths and support networks.

The therapy is structured, short-term, and goal-oriented, focusing on the present. It provides education on mental health challenges and equips individuals with skills and strategies, such as problem-solving and realistic thinking, to help them make changes in their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. As they practice these skills, individuals often find that they become more adept at managing future challenges, ultimately leading to improved mental functioning and well-being.",1706961,"How does CBT help individuals manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by explaining how CBT helps individuals manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

"The legalization of cannabis in Canada allows for the establishment of regulations that can help minimize potential harms associated with its use. Since cannabis became legal in Canada on October 17, 2018, it is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and is sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch, where it is tested for quality. This regulatory framework enables consumers to know the contents and dosage of the cannabis they are using, which helps in managing risks associated with its consumption.

"The key differences between mental health and mental illness are primarily centered around their definitions and how they are experienced by individuals. 

1. **Definition**: Mental health refers to our overall mental well-being, encompassing our emotions, thoughts, feelings, problem-solving abilities, social connections, and understanding of the world. In contrast, mental illness is a specific condition that affects the way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others and is linked to symptoms that disrupt daily functioning.

2. **Universality**: Everyone has mental health, just as everyone has physical health. Throughout life, people may experience challenges with their mental health, but not all will encounter a mental illness. Conversely, mental illness is experienced by a portion of the population, with estimates indicating that 1 in 5 adults in America have a mental illness.

3. **Continuum**: Mental health exists on a continuum, where individuals can experience varying degrees of mental well-being, ranging from good to poor health. Mental illness also exists on a spectrum, with some illnesses being mild and only slightly interfering with life, while others, such as major depression or schizophrenia, can result in significant functional impairment.

4. **Episodic Nature**: Mental illnesses can be episodic, meaning individuals may have periods of poor mental health interspersed with times of recovery or good health. This indicates that a person with a mental illness can still maintain good mental health during less symptomatic phases.

5. **Treatment**: Mental health can improve with supportive strategies and coping mechanisms, while mental illness often requires specific medical treatment, including medications and therapy.
