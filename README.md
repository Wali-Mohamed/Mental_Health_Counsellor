Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health is integral to living a healthy, balanced life. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Emotional and mental health is important because itâ€™s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or care-giving.

People with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely.
