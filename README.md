### Problem Statement

Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, impacting emotional, psychological, and social aspects of life. It affects how individuals think, feel, and behave, as well as their ability to handle stress, form relationships, and make decisions. Despite its importance, mental health issues are widespread, and navigating reliable information on mental health can be challenging.

To address this, our project aims to provide accessible, reliable answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about mental health. Using a large language model (LLM) trained on a dataset compiled from trusted sources, this project delivers insights into common mental health questions, helping users understand and manage their mental well-being effectively.

This project leverages data from sources such as:
- [The Kim Foundation](https://www.thekimfoundation.org/faqs/)
- [Mental Health America](https://www.mhanational.org/frequently-asked-questions)
- [Wellness in Mind](https://www.wellnessinmind.org/frequently-asked-questions/)
- [Here to Help BC](https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/questions-and-answers)

Our goal is to make mental health information more accessible and improve awareness, ultimately supporting better mental health outcomes.
